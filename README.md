## Context and motivations
### Software factory rational
Let's first tackle what is obvious: CI/CD practices are a requirement of any activity within software industry, because of efficiency, quality and security it adds to software delivery. Software factory (sf) is the enabler of CI/CD practices.

### Software factory as a service
Now, let's take a look at the sf within a professional context. As of today, anybody can (quite easily) implement a software factory thanks to solutions such GitHub. The independant developer working on a mobile app can setup within minutes a new CI/CD chain. 

When it comes to corporate context, sf is usually getting implemented as a corporate service. As any service, it has a provider and a consumer. Depending on the structure in which sf is delivered, provider-consumer relationship can be very different. 
- In small company, provider and consumer can belong to the same team and work next to each other.
- If you move to larger organization, provider and consumer might belong to different teams, sitting in distant location, living in different timezones, and the number of consumers can get far larger than the team that is providing sf.
